### Certification Prep.

The following are links to some study aids for those wanting to dive deeper or study for the certification.

#### Hashicorp

Hashicorp is the company that makes Terraform and administers the certification exam. Their certification prep is the first resource you should consult.

The official study guide that we reviewed in class is at the link below.

It is strongly recommended that you do all the tutorials in the study guide. A good measure of how well you are doing is if you understand exactly what is happening in each step

[Hashicorp Official Study Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-study-003)

#### Free Code Camp

Free code camp does a good job of providing free learning resources. Their study guide for certification is located at the link below

[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terraform-certified-associate-003-study-notes/)

They also have a free seven hour course that is a certification prep

And the video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcwo0Gq9T8)

#### Coursera

I haven't reviewed the content of this course but Coursera usually has pretty good free self study courses. The nice thing about Coursera is that you are given a structured course outline to follow.

_Remember that the best way to study is to just do worked problems and ensure that you understand exactly what is happening as you work through the steps._
